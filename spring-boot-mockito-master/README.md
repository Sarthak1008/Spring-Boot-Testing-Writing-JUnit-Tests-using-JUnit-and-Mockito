<p>Testing is a critical aspect of software development to ensure the reliability and correctness of your application. In a Spring Boot application, you can write tests using frameworks like JUnit and Mockito to test various components such as controllers, services, repositories, etc. Let's create a basic project structure and write some tests using JUnit and Mockito.</p>

<p>JUnit is a popular testing framework for Java, while Mockito is a mocking framework that allows you to create mock objects in tests.</p>

<strong> Steps: </strong>
<p>Dependency Setup: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies in your pom.xml file for JUnit and Mockito:</p>
<p>Writing Test Classes:
Create test classes for your Spring components (e.g., services, controllers) in the src/test/java directory. Annotate your test classes with @RunWith(SpringRunner.class) to enable Spring test support.</p>
<p>Injecting Mocks:
Use Mockito to mock dependencies of the class you are testing. You can annotate fields with @Mock or use Mockito.mock() method</p>
<p>Initializing Mocks:
Use @Before or @BeforeEach methods to initialize mocks before each test method runs.</p>
<p>Writing Test Methods:
Write test methods to test the behavior of your Spring components. Use Mockito's mocking and verification features to set up expectations and verify interactions</p>
